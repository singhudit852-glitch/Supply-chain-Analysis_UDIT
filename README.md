# Supply-chain-Analysis_UDIT   
This project presents a 3-page interactive Power BI Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard designed to provide end-to-end visibility into product performance, logistics efficiency, inventory levels, and sales trends.

The dashboard integrates supply chain, logistics, and sales data to track key KPIs such as Total Revenue, Total Costs, Average Profit Margin, Average Defect Rate, Stock Levels, and Order Quantity. Interactive slicers for product, region, and time period, along with structured page navigation, enable dynamic data exploration and performance monitoring.

Through KPI and trend analysis, the dashboard uncovers revenue growth patterns (~15–20%), defect rate variations (~10–12%), and inventory overstock risks (~12–18%), helping identify opportunities for cost optimization, inventory control, and operational improvement.
